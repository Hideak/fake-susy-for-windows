### Introduction
Susy is a code-submission-website provided by the University of Campinas (Unicamp), Brazil, to evaluate student's coding performance.
It contains open and closed tests, and code can be submited only a limited number of times.

Fake SuSy for Windows provide **unlimited attempts** while using the open tests in a submission-like way of testing code. It can save boring and precious time wasted while typing all the entries one by one. It also uses in/out redirection to generate and display your application's output apart from the input

### A binary Release for Windows
As the project continues going foward, a binary release will be posted in my official web page, which you can access through the following link: https://hideak.github.io.
